# midiget
Midiget allows you to crawl the pages of a website recursively and easily to download all hosted midi files. The programme is ideal to automate file retrieving from large midi repositories like www.vgmusic.com and www.midiworld.com  

# Usage
Launch midiget from the command line specifying the url of the target website from which you want to download the files: 
```
python midiget http://www.vgmusic.com/
```
You must be in the midiget directory when launching the program. In the example above, midiget starts crawling the pages of vgmusic.com in search for midi files. 

When launching the program, it is also possible to input a second (numerical) argument in order to specify the maximum number of pages midiget will visit before halting:
```
python midiget http://www.vgmusic.com/ 1000
```
If the second argument is not provided, the maximum number of pages is defaulted to 1000.

You can specify the output directory as the third argument:
```
python midiget http://www.vgmusic.com/ 1000 ../vgmusic
```

The files downloaded are saved in a directory called 'midisaves', placed in the root directory of the programme.
